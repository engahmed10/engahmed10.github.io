When i started to study computer engineering long time ago, my high school score took me to that track ,actually ,
i just wanted  to finish my bachoulers  degree and get job or  travel to see world ,after i graduated and i traveled to other  country  ,and studied  higher degree ,after finished . My final  trip was USA , i  worked in different  positions and studied some collage classes in IT  and programming ,also i got  online IT  certificates to improve my skills , but i wasn't in much hope  because of not have much experience in my resume , and i needed to work for  my daily life  and got  married ,and we  got little baby so my responsibilities  became more ,iam very  happy for my life but i was always feeling worry for our future .
  
My big reason to  study bootcamp in software engineering   that  i'm kind of person  always feels like  "everything is nothing  ,if you don't do something ", so i decieded to help my future ,my family  and help peoples in the future ,i realized the best  thing to do to be coding challenger. My visions to bootcamps successes to help people to give more experience and information to get jobs in multi positions of software engineering ,i decided to search the  best bootcamp in the world ,and i found the flatiron school one of the best bootcamps in the world . My goal not just getting a job in software engineering , but also  to be very good in my job ,and making the company be proud and happy to hire me . 
My big dream in the  future to do something  to world to  get benefit from that.
