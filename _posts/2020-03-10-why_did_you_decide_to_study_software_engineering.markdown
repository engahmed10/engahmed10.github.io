When I was in high school, I’ve always wanted to study Computer Engineering. After I graduated with a bachelor’s degree, I traveled to several countries to pursue a higher degree. When i moved to the USA, i worked in various positions, took some college classes in IT and programming to improve my skills and received online certificates. But I don’t have much experience to show on my resume, therefore, I worry because I got married recently, have a baby and have responsibilities toward my family. I am very happy with my family but also worry for the future.

My main reason to join the bootcamp is to study Software Engineering. I’m a very goal-oriented person and I personally feel without making major changes or taking an action, you cannot accomplish anything in your career. So, I decided to take action to help my family, my future and people I want help with my skills. Bootcamps help people to learn and get you ready to face the real-life experience. Software Engineering have variety of roles, so I decided to look for the best bootcamp and I came across Flatiron, which has very high ranking. I want to become a successful Software Engineer and whichever company hire me; I want them to be proud of me. My goal is to do something big in the future for the people (maybe build an website or app ), which they can get benefit from.
